# MathGL.jl

![main example](/graphs/main_example.png?raw=true)

**This repository probably still has major issues and is a work in
progress**

MathGL.jl provides a wrapper for the feature-rich scientific visualization
library [MathGL](http://mathgl.sourceforge.net) written in C++. It relies
on the C interface of MathGL, wrapping it with julia to a convenient
degree.

MathGL.jl is currently under construction, still lacks a part of the
functions provided by MathGL and is probably not portable (only linux
tested). Plotting functions from the section "4.14 Dual plotting" on in
the [documentation](http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/doc_en/Main.html)
are still missing, the rest should be implemented (with few exceptions).

Note that MathGL.jl does not aim to wrap all of MathGL (the numerical
routines, the classes for storing numerical data, the pde solvers and
fitting procedures), but only its capacity to create graphs.

### Requirements 
Besides the code of this repository you will need a working and up-to-date
version of libmgl in a folder that julia can find via `find_library`. For
additional functions (which are *not* supported yet), like qt, glut, etc.
the corresponding libraries (e.g. libmgl-qt5) must also be installed
properly.


### Usage and Examples 
#### The C Interface 
The C functions provided by MathGL are callable via the Capi submodule of
MathGL. The Capi-module is more or less complete (some functions may be
missing, but most functionality is certainly implemented); however,
it is not comfortable to use. Documentation regarding the Capi (function
names and their description) may be found in the 
[MathGL documentation](http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/doc_en/Main.html).

An example: 
```julia
using MathGL.Capi
mgl = MathGL.Capi

gr  = mgl.create_graph(800, 500)
dat = mgl.create_data()
mgl.data_link(dat, 0.8*sin(linspace(-4pi, 4pi, 200)), 200, 1, 1)
mgl.label(gr, 'x', "x", 0, "")
mgl.label(gr, 'y', "y", 0, "")
mgl.box(gr)
mgl.axis(gr, "xyz", "", "")
mgl.axis_grid(gr, "xyz", "H|", "")
mgl.plot(gr, dat, "", "")
mgl.write_frame(gr, "sin_C.png", "")
```
![sin_C example](/graphs/sin_C.png?raw=true)
Note however, that the C interface only conducts limited type checks, so
expect segfaults when using the wrong argument types.

#### The Higher Level Julian Interface 
The type structure was (quite loosely) modeled after the C++ class
structure of MathGL, the most important type being the `Graph`. The
function names (e.g. `text`, `surf`, `plot`, `xtics`, ...) were -- whenever
possible -- chosen to be the corresponding commands of the MathGL scripting
language (see the [documentation](http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/doc_en/Main.html) for
the details). This was done for several reasons:
    
* The names of the mgl commands are very julian (e.g. few underscores,
  heavily overloaded)
* The C interface is tedious, the C++ interface does not really
  fit well
* An abuse of julia's matrix construction syntax makes it possible to
  write mgl script code directly in julia (with some slight
  alterations, see [below](#abusing-the-matrix-syntax-imitating-mgl-scripts-in-julia)).

There are, however, important functions that are not covered by the
scripting language, which is designed to handle one graph only.
Some of these deviations of function names can be found in the file
[changes.md](/changes.md), the most important ones are given
[below](#changes-to-mathgl).

An equivalent example to the one above in the julian interface:
```julia
using MathGL
mgl = MathGL

gr  = mgl.Graph(800, 500)
mgl.xlabel(gr, "x")
mgl.ylabel(gr, "y")
mgl.box(gr)
mgl.axis(gr)
mgl.grid(gr)
mgl.plot(gr, 0.8*sin(linspace(-4pi, 4pi, 200)))
mgl.write(gr, "sin_julia.png")
```

#### Abusing the Matrix Syntax: Imitating MathGL Scripts in Julia 
To make it short, the following code sample is perfectly equivalent to the
one above:
```julia
using MathGL

gr = MathGL.Graph(800, 500)
@mglplot gr [
    xlabel "x"
    ylabel "y"
    box
    axis
    grid
    plot 0.8*sin(linspace(-4pi, 4pi, 200))
    write "sin_mgl.png"
]
```
This is nice because the syntax given in the macro resembles the
MGL script syntax quite well. Of course there are deviations (e.g. always
the keyword `stl` is used, never `fnt` or `sch` or ...).

## Examples
Examples can be found in the folder [examples](/examples). Right now the only relevant
example is the one creating the picture at the top of this repository,
[here](/examples/main_example.jl).

## Changes to MathGL
Not yet decided ... 

## TODO
* Make all plotting functions accessible from julia
* Provide some more utility functions
* Write some documentation / tutorials for the usage of MathGL
* Implement the gui graph classes of MathGL
* Testing! Not much is tested, there are certainly tons of bugs yet
undiscovered (but easy to resolve)
* Document the changes compared to MathGL
